            Yes! I can modify exercises and create a program tailored to your needs. However, I always recommend
            consulting with your doctor before starting any fitness program if you have an existing condition.

            Results depend on your commitment, consistency, and starting point. Many clients see noticeable improvements
            within 4â€“6 weeks with regular training and proper nutrition.

            Not necessarily! I can design a workout plan using just bodyweight exercises. However, if you have
            dumbbells, resistance bands, or other equipment, we can incorporate them for better results.

            Yes! Nutrition is a key part of achieving your fitness goals. I provide general nutrition advice and
            meal-planning tips to support your workouts, but for detailed meal plans, I recommend working with a
            registered dietitian.
